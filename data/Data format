First column: Starting point -> The first column indicates the time at which the song starts in the audio file in seconds.

Second column: Ending point -> The second column indicates the time at which the song ends in the audio file in seconds.

In some cases the beginning or ending or both could be missing from the audio file so the next two columns indicate how
much of the audio file is missing from the beginning and the end.

Third column: Starting offset -> If the starting offset is 0 that means the beginning is not cut off. If the starting 
offset is negative that indicates how many seconds before the audio file the song started.

Fourth column: Ending offset -> If the ending offset is 0 that means the end of the song is not cut off. If the ending
offset is positive that indicates how many seconds after the end of the audio file the song ends.
